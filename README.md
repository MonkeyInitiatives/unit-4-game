# Unit-4-Game

### Overview
This is a simple "RPG" game where a user first selects their playable character. Then, the user is tasked with selecting from one of the remaining fighters who will be the defender. Once both players are selected, the user will attack and the computer will counter attack. The player's attack will grow in size by their base damage while the enemy's damage will remain constant. Once a player is defeated, the process repeats with the user selecting a new fighter to fight. The player wins when all enemies are defeated or when the player loses all of their health.

### Options

There is an option to play background music as the user plays the game by clicking on the Music tab at the top of the page. At any time the user may choose to restart the game by clicking New Game.
